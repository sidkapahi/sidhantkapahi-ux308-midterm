## Drama - As a Genre

When it comes to the live form of entertainment, Drama is not as popular as the form of live action entertainment 'musicals.' Although this is the case, plenty of people love play's as they provide a serious and often great stories with characters and sets that you can feel and see change. Often done in theatres, there is a production end to this. Foremen/women have their own language for how lighting should be and set changes as well.
