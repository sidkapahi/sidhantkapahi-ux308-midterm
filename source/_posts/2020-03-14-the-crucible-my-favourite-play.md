## Context

So there might be a heavy bias here, I really enjoy plays but also I was in high-school when I first say this play. I am naturally an actor and have a lot of fun playing others while on stage. However in high-school I didn't act, I observed, and I went to go watch this play when it was being hosted at my high-school. I then watched it in Mirvish theatre downtown later that year, done by professionals.

## What makes this play so good?

Well, besides the amazing actors, I really enjoyed the story. Focusing on characters in Salem, it was interesting seeing people being accused of witchcraft and wizardry to then be punished for doing so. In comparison, not-being a witch or wizard gets you killed. It is interesting to see the struggles of the olden days and how to dissipate blame, the idea of witches was used as a scape-goat. Overall a definite recommendation to anyone looking into watching plays.
